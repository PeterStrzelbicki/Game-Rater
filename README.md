## About Game Rater
Game Rater is a user-friendly application developed in C# that allows gamers to keep track of their games and rate them. With Game Rater, users can simply enter their Steam, Playstation, Xbox, or Nintendo Switch ID to automatically import their game library into the app. 

Alternatively, the user is also able to enter a custom game if it is not on any of the provided platforms. Once the game library is imported, users can easily rate each game on a scale of 1 to 10.
